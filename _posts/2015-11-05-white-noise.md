What is an ideal work environment? 

Sometime you will feel your brain is frozen by a *deadly quietness*.

Maybe a coffee shop with few but not a lot of people. Some background music is okay. But better not in a language that you can understand, so you won't be distracted by the lyrics. Some people's chatting is okay. But better not too clear, so you won't be attracted by their conversation. 

The are several apps and websites provides **white noise sounds**. They are random noise generated at several frequencies just like white light is a mix of all frequencies of light. This is a ideal background to break the *deadly quietness*.

Some white noise sounds are provided by named theme, like raining, wind, bonfire... I had tried some of them but found them too artificial, until I found this one.

Currently, this is my favorite. Enjoy.
